## Create a twitter bot that will post a random meme from a youtube playlist every 24 hours
# - THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY
# - I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CONTENT IN THE PLAYLIST

#Steps

# 1. Create a dictionary containing the youtube link and the mp3 file location
     - Download the mp3 file from the youtube link

# 2. Create a function that will randomly select a meme from the dictionary
     - Then append that dictionary so that it does not post duplicates
     - If the dictionary is empty, then it will repopulate the dictionary

# 3. Create a function that will post the meme to twitter once a day
